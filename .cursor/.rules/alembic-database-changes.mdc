When modifying a model, follow these steps:

1. Create a migration:

   - Run: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description_of_change"`

2. Review the migration:

   - Carefully check the generated migration before applying.

3. Apply the migration:
   - Execute: `alembic upgrade head`

For effective schema management, integrate these practices into your workflow:

- Use explicit table names in all models.
- Synchronize models and database schema by generating migrations promptly.
- Regularly test database queries against the actual schema.
