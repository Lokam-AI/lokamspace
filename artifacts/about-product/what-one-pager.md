# ðŸš— Lokam â€” Voiceâ€‘AI That Turns Feedback Into Revenue  

Lokam builds **multilingual Voiceâ€‘AI assistants** that call customers minutes after a service is completed, capture rich feedback in their own language, and automatically trigger the next best actionâ€”from sending a Googleâ€‘review link to opening a CRM ticket.  
We start with the automotive afterâ€‘sales marketâ€”an industry where reputation, retention, and upsell hinge on timely, authentic customer conversations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission  
Give every customer a real voiceâ€¯â€”â€¯while turning feedback loops into measurable growth for businesses.

## ðŸ›‘ The Problem  
* **Manual & expensive** CSI/NPS surveys (USDâ€¯3â€‘5â€¯k/month via BPOs).  
* **<20â€¯% response rates** and oneâ€‘dimensional scores that surface days later.  
* Multilingual markets (Arabic, English, Hindi, Malayalam) where legacy IVRs fail.  
* Missed opportunities for public reviews and proactive service recovery.

## ðŸ’¡ Our Solution  
A cloudâ€‘native Voiceâ€‘AI platform that:  

1. **Calls customers automatically** when a repair order closes.  
2. **Converses in real time** (<300â€¯ms latency) using TTS + ASR fineâ€‘tuned for regional dialects.  
3. **Tags transcripts** for sentiment, intent, NPS, and rootâ€‘cause codes.  
4. **Triggers actions:**  
   * Promoters â†’ WhatsApp link to post a Google review  
   * Detractors â†’ Instant escalation ticket with call audio  
5. **Learns continuously**â€”selfâ€‘optimising scripts boost pickâ€‘up & completion rates every two weeks.
